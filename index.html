            <p>
              Ever since I was young, I've had a passion for cooking. My journey began in the family kitchen, where I eagerly helped my parents and learned their techniques. This early exposure sparked a lifelong interest in culinary arts. During high school, I honed my skills further by working in a fast food restaurant, gaining valuable experience in food preparation and service. By the age of 16, I knew I wanted to pursue cooking as a career.

              <br><br>I am fascinated by the science behind cooking. Understanding the "why" behind a recipe not only makes it easier to tweak and improve but also allows for the creation of entirely new dishes. The interplay of flavors and ingredients is something I deeply enjoy exploring.
